Collection of assignments for a Software Development class


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  When a user desires a particular feature, it usually comes in the form of a functional request or an issue they have with a current feature. User Stories boil these down into actionable items, that can be directly addressed with updates to the software.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I hope to incorporate the teamwork and communication aspects of Agile into my future work. These processes are critical to success anywhere, and allow for the most efficiency, flexibility, and productivity in the development process.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  A good team member is responsive to communication, receptive to criticism, and always has a positive attitude.
